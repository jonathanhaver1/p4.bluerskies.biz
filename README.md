DESCRIPTION of the application

Keep your communication agenda always up to date
and access it from everywhere.
This application keeps an ADDRESS BOOK and a contact
(communication) TO DO list. Once a TO DO is completed,
it will appear in the DONE list.
You can communicate with your contacts using SIP,
Skype, phone, email, mobile text messaging (using all
the popular carriers) and more.
On a mobile phone (or if you have a phone application
on your computer) the dialler will be called up automatically
and the phone number processed.
The application also shows the status of an email
domain (Internet DNS and MX records), the Skype status of a
contact, and has additional features.
